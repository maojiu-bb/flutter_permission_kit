/// Flutter plugin entry point for Flutter Permission Kit on iOS
///
/// This class serves as the main entry point and coordinator for the Flutter
/// Permission Kit plugin on the iOS platform. It implements the FlutterPlugin
/// protocol to integrate with Flutter's plugin system and handles communication
/// between the Flutter layer and native iOS code.
///
/// The plugin follows Flutter's standard plugin architecture:
/// 1. Registration: The plugin registers itself with Flutter during app startup
/// 2. Method Channel: Establishes a communication channel with the Flutter layer
/// 3. Method Handling: Routes incoming method calls to appropriate handlers
/// 4. Result Delivery: Returns results back to the Flutter layer
///
/// Key responsibilities:
/// - Plugin lifecycle management and registration
/// - Method channel setup and maintenance
/// - Method call routing and delegation
/// - Error handling and result communication
/// - Integration with Flutter's plugin ecosystem
///
/// Architecture flow:
/// ```
/// Flutter App (Dart)
///        ↓ (Method Channel: "flutter_permission_kit")
/// FlutterPermissionKitPlugin ← You are here
///        ↓ (Delegates to)
/// CorePermissionKit
///        ↓
/// iOS Permission APIs
/// ```

public class FlutterPermissionKitPlugin: NSObject, FlutterPlugin {
    
    /// Registers the plugin with Flutter's plugin system
    ///
    /// This static method is called automatically by Flutter during app startup
    /// to register the plugin and establish the method channel communication.
    /// It's the entry point for the entire plugin lifecycle.
    ///
    /// The registration process:
    /// 1. Creates a method channel with the identifier "flutter_permission_kit"
    /// 2. Instantiates the plugin class
    /// 3. Registers the plugin instance as the method call delegate
    /// 4. Establishes the communication bridge with Flutter
    ///
    /// - Parameter registrar: Flutter plugin registrar that manages plugin lifecycle
    ///   The registrar provides:
    ///   - Binary messenger for method channel communication
    ///   - Plugin lifecycle management
    ///   - Resource access and management
    ///
    /// Channel identifier: "flutter_permission_kit"
    /// This identifier must match exactly with the channel name used in the
    /// Flutter/Dart code to ensure proper message routing.
    ///
    /// Example Flutter usage:
    /// ```dart
    /// static const MethodChannel _channel = MethodChannel('flutter_permission_kit');
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note: This method is called automatically by Flutter and should not
    /// be invoked manually by application code.

        // Create an instance of the plugin to handle method calls
        let instance = FlutterPermissionKitPlugin()
        
        // Register this plugin instance as the delegate for method calls
        // All method calls from Flutter will be routed to the handle(_:result:) method

    /// Handles incoming method calls from the Flutter layer
    ///
    /// This method serves as the central dispatcher for all method calls received
    /// from the Flutter layer through the method channel. It examines the method
    /// name and routes the call to the appropriate handler.
    ///
    /// The method follows Flutter's standard plugin pattern:
    /// 1. Receive the method call with parameters
    /// 2. Examine the method name to determine the requested operation
    /// 3. Route to the appropriate handler or return "not implemented"
    /// 4. Ensure the result callback is always called
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - call: FlutterMethodCall containing:
    ///     - method: String identifier for the requested operation
    ///     - arguments: Optional parameters for the method call
    ///   
    ///   - result: FlutterResult callback that must be called to return the result
    ///     - Success: Call with the return value
    ///     - Error: Call with FlutterError
    ///     - Not implemented: Call with FlutterMethodNotImplemented
    ///
    /// Supported methods:
    /// - "init": Initializes the permission kit with configuration
    ///   - Delegates to: CorePermissionKit.share.initPermissionKit(_:result:)
    ///   - Parameters: Configuration dictionary from Flutter
    ///   - Returns: Boolean indicating initialization success
    ///
    /// Error handling:
    /// - Unknown methods return FlutterMethodNotImplemented
    /// - Invalid parameters are handled by the delegate methods
    /// - All errors are properly communicated back to Flutter
    ///
    /// Example method call from Flutter:
    /// ```dart
    /// final result = await _channel.invokeMethod('init', configData);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Implementation notes:
    /// - The result callback must always be called exactly once
    /// - Method names are case-sensitive
    /// - The switch statement should handle all supported methods
    /// - New methods should be added as additional cases
